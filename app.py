### How is this calculated?

This app uses a machine learning model trained on symptom and lifestyle data to estimate your risk of an IBS flare-up.
We look at stress, diet, sleep, hydration, and your recent symptom history.
This is not a diagnosis â€” just a tool to help you manage patterns and habits.
