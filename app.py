# Explanation
st.markdown("""
### How is this calculated?

This app uses a machine learning model trained on symptom and lifestyle data to estimate your risk of an IBS flare-up.
We look at stress, diet, sleep, hydration, and your recent symptom history.
It uses both current data and recognized scientific patterns (e.g., high spice and stress correlation with IBS).

> Research-backed logic: High-stress, low-sleep, and high-spice consumption days are more likely to result in flare-ups. 
> This model improves the more you use it, offering smarter alerts and behavior tips.

This is not a diagnosis â€” just a tool to help you manage patterns and habits.
